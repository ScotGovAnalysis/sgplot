# Getting help with sgplot

Thanks for using sgplot!

## Where to ask for help

* If it's a question: Ask the Scottish Government [R Yammer community](https://web.yammer.com/main/groups/eyJfdHlwZSI6Ikdyb3VwIiwiaWQiOiI2MzQ4MzE2NjczIn0).
  
*   If it's a bug: [file an issue](https://github.com/DataScienceScotland/sgplot/issues/new) on GitHub.  
  
*   If you're not sure or aren't comfortable with either of these options, contact the [package maintainers](https://datasciencescotland.github.io/sgplot/authors.html#authors).

Before opening a new issue, be sure to [search issues and pull requests](https://github.com/DataScienceScotland/sgplot/issues) to make sure the bug hasn't been reported and/or already fixed in the development version. 
By default, the search will be pre-populated with `is:issue is:open`. 
You can [edit the qualifiers](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/)  (e.g. `is:pr`, `is:closed`) as needed. 
For example, you'd simply remove `is:open` to search **all** issues in the repo, open or closed.

## How to ask for help

Try to explain your problem as clearly as possible. This could involve explaining what you are trying to do and what the expected and actual behaviour of your code is. 

It can be very useful to include a minimal **repr**oducible **ex**ample (reprex) using the [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package. For help using reprex, see the [Get help](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) section of the tidyverse site.

Being able to reproduce your problem greatly increases the chances of us being able to help you.
