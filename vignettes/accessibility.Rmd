Accessibility legislation means that all content published on public sector websites, including charts, must meet the level A and AA success criterion in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). 

The [Government Analysis Function](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/) has produced [guidance for producing charts](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/data-visualisation-charts/) that meet this criteria. Where possible, sgplot functions follow advice in this guidance , however, using sgplot does not guarantee accessibility. sgplot should therefore be used in conjunction with this guidance.

## Accessibility of charts using sgplot

By applying `theme_sg` to ggplot2 plots, the following best practice is followed:

* Plot background is white.

* Axis lines, ticks and labels are dark grey (#d9d9d9).

* Grid lines are light grey (#595959) and kept to a minimum; by default only major y axis lines are shown, but this can be controlled using the `grid` argument.

* Text is black, uses [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) font (as per the Scottish Government [design system](https://designsystem.gov.scot/styles/typography/#font)) and is size 12 by default. Text size can be controlled using the `base_size` argument.

* All text is horizontal.

* Line thickness is relative to font size.

Colour palettes from the Government Analysis Function [Data visualisation: colours](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/data-visualisation-colours-in-charts/) guidance have been used in sgplot. These take into account the general considerations set out in accessibility legislation and all have sufficient colour contrast against a white background. These palettes can be applied to charts by using one of the four colour/fill functions:

* `scale_colour_discrete_sg()`
* `scale_fill_discrete_sg()`
* `scale_colour_continuous_sg()`
* `scale_fill_continuous_sg()`

More information on colour palettes in sgplot can be found at `vignette("colours")`.

## Other accessibility considerations

Using sgplot does not guarantee accessibility. The Analysis Function [chart guidance](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/data-visualisation-charts) contains detailed information on other considerations that should be made. 

These are a few key things to consider:

* Consider what type of chart is best to convey your message. Keep it as simple as possible.

* Plot titles should be provided in the body of the page, not embedded within the image of the plot. This does pose the risk of the plot image being re-shared without the title and losing context, however it is usually preferable to [prioritise accessibility](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/data-visualisation-charts/#section-6).

* All plots must have alt text (this may be in the code behind an image of the plot, but could also be a table of data or a text description of the message the chart is presenting).

* Take great care if using a [stacked bar chart](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/data-visualisation-charts/#section-10). Keep the number of categories to a minimum, and carefully consider the order of categories and bars.

* If horizontal text is difficult to read (for example, if axis labels are overlapping), consider a different chart orientation or type.

* If using a bar chart, the gap between bars should be narrower than the width of a single bar.

* [Ask for feedback](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/data-visualisation-charts/#section-15) from colleagues and users.
