# Saving charts

This article covers best practice guidance for saving charts as images.
This may be as a standalone image file, or embedded in a document
produced using R Markdown.

This guidance follows recommendations in the [Government Analysis
Function charts
guidance](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/data-visualisation-charts/#section-4).

In summary, the following good practice is recommended:

- Save charts in SVG image format.

- Size a chart to be roughly the same width as the content surrounding
  it.

- For landscape charts on an A4 page, 159 mm x 100 mm are good
  dimensions.

- Remember to include alt text when including charts in an R Markdown
  document.

## File format

The best format to save images of charts is Scalable Vector Graphic
(SVG) format. SVG files retain the same quality regardless of the size
they are viewed at. This means SVG images are more accessible than other
image formats such as JPG or PNG.

You can find an [example of a chart image in an SVG, JPEG and PNG format
on
GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/examples-of-visual-content-to-use-on-govuk/examples-of-visual-content-to-use-on-govuk#image-formats-for-charts).

If you cannot use an SVG image, then a JPG or PNG image is acceptable.

## Size and dimensions

A chart should follow the flow of the content surrounding it. It should
be roughly the same width as the text before and after the image.

The dimensions of your chart will depend on where you plan to use it.
For example, if you’re using a page-based document such as Microsoft
Word, and would like to include a landscape image on an A4 portrait
page, a width of 159 mm and height of 100 mm works well.

When using the SVG file format, actual saved image dimensions will be
exactly as specified. However, when using JPG or PNG formats, they may
not be. This is because these file formats are also influenced by DPI
(dots per inch). DPI is a measure of the resolution of an image; the
higher the DPI, the more crisp and good quality your image will be. This
is another good reason to use SVG over these formats, however if you are
limited to JPG or PNG, it may take some trial and error to find the
correct combination of width, height and DPI.

## Examples

### Standalone image file

The [`ggsave()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsave.html)
function from `ggplot2` can be used to save a standalone image file. To
specify the SVG file format, simply ensure your file name ends with
`.svg`. The following example uses the recommended dimensions from the
previous section.

``` r
ggsave(myplot, filename = "example-plot.svg",
       width = 159, height = 100, units = "mm")
```

For a JPG or PNG image, also consider the DPI value. In `ggsave`, this
can be supplied as a numerical value, or as a string input. For best
quality, use “retina”.

``` r
ggsave(myplot, filename = "example-plot.png",
       width = 159, height = 100, units = "mm", dpi = "retina")
```

### R Markdown

For charts in an R Markdown document, file format, dimensions and other
settings can be set in the code chunk options.

- **Format**: Set `dev = "svg"`, otherwise the default format of `png`
  will be used.

- **Dimensions**: Set `fig.height` and `fig.width`. For HTML outputs,
  the default figure dimensions are often suitable, however when
  knitting to Microsoft Word, the default dimensions often result in a
  small image and so it is best to specify these in the R Markdown code
  chunk. Note that R Markdown requires figure dimensions in inches. If
  you’d rather use millimetres, use the `mm_to_inch` helper function
  from sgplot.

- **Alt Text**: For HTML outputs, use `fig.alt`, and for Microsoft Word
  outputs, `fig.cap`. Note that by default, the value given to `fig.cap`
  will be shown under the chart. If you’d rather turn this off, you can
  control this in the R Markdown YAML header:

  ``` yaml
  output: 
    word_document:
     fig_caption: no
  ```

Set these options in a code chunk header:

```` markdown
```{r plot1, dev = "svg", fig.width = mm_to_inch(159), fig.height = mm_to_inch(100), fig.alt = "A description of plot1"}
plot1
```
````

It can sometimes make your code easier to read by specifying chunk
options within the chunk:

```` markdown
```{r plot1}
#| dev = "svg"
#| fig.width = mm_to_inch(159)
#| fig.height = mm_to_inch(100)
#| fig.alt = "A description of plot1"

plot1
```
````

If you would like all of your images to be in the same format, it is
usually easier to set options globally in the first code chunk of your
document:

```` markdown
```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  dev = "svg",
  fig.width = mm_to_inch(159), 
  fig.height = mm_to_inch(100)
)
```
````

Note that sgplot must be loaded before setting global options, otherwise
you will need to specify the package when calling `mm_to_inch`;
e.g. [`sgplot::mm_to_inch()`](https://ScotGovAnalysis.github.io/sgplot/dev/reference/mm_to_inch.md).

There may be cases where you’d like all charts to be in SVG format, but
with different dimensions. In this case you can set `dev = "svg"` in the
global options and `fig.width` and `fig.height` for each code chunk
separately.

#### Knitting to Microsoft Word

- You may receive a warning message referring to `rsvg-convert` when
  knitting an R Markdown document containing SVG images to Microsoft
  Word. This can be safely ignored.

- It is not possible to centre charts or images when knitting to
  Microsoft Word. A workaround for this is to [use a Word style template
  document](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/word-template.html#word-template).
