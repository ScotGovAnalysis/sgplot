# sgplot

[![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/DataScienceScotland/sgplot)](https://github.com/DataScienceScotland/sgplot/releases/latest)
[![R build status](https://github.com/DataScienceScotland/sgplot/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DataScienceScotland/sgplot/actions)

`sgplot` contains functions for creating graphics in the Scottish Government. 

The following functions are available:

- `scs_theme()` to apply a consistent theme to ggplot charts
- `scale_colour_discrete_scs()` to apply discrete colour scales for charts
- `scale_colour_continuouse_scs()` to apply continuous colour scales for charts
- `scale_fill_discrete_scs()` to apply discrete colour filling scales for charts
- `scale_fill_continuous_scs()` to apply continuous colour filling scales for charts

The available colours have been selected using the [Government Statistical Service (GSS) Data visualisation: colours guidance](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/data-visualisation-colours-in-charts/). Names and hex codes for available colours and palettes can be viewed by running the following code:

```{r view-colours, eval = FALSE}
# View names and hex codes for all colours
scs_colour_values

# View names and hex codes for all colour palettes
scs_colour_palettes

# View names and hex codes for `main` colour palette
scs_colour_palettes[["main"]]
```

The following colour palettes are available: main, sequential and focus.


## Installation

To install `sgplot`, the package `remotes` is required. The package can be installed directly from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github(
  "DataScienceScotland/sgplot",
  upgrade = "never"
)
```

Network security settings may prevent `remotes::install_github()` from working. If this is the case, `sgplot` can be installed by downloading the [zip of the repository](https://github.com/DataScienceScotland/sgplot/archive/main.zip) and running the following code (replacing the section marked `<>`, including the arrows themselves):

```{r source-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_local(
  "<FILEPATH OF ZIPPED FILE>/sgplot-main.zip",
  upgrade = "never"
)
```

The `sgplot` package can then be loaded using the `library()` function:

```{r library, eval = FALSE}
library(sgplot)
```

To access the help file associated with a function within the `sgplot` package, type `?function_name` into the RStudio console, for example:

```{r help-file, eval = FALSE}
?scs_theme
```
